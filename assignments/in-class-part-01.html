        <strong>The Tin Drum (German: Die Blechtrommel) </strong>is a 1979 film adaptation of the novel of the same name by Günter Grass.<hr /> It was directed and co-written by Volker Schlöndorff. It was mostly shot in West Germany.</br>
        The film won the Palme d'Or at the 1979 Cannes Film Festival and the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1980 at the 52nd Academy Awards. 
        Oskar is born in Germany in 1924 with an advanced intellect. 
        Repulsed by the hypocrisy of adults and the irresponsibility of society, he refuses to grow older after his third birthday.
        While the chaotic world around him careers toward the madness and folly of World War II, Oskar pounds incessantly on his beloved tin drum and perfects his uncannily piercing shrieks.
