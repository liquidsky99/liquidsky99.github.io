          <p><strong>Introduction: </strong></p><p>I live in Lake Hills in Bellevue which is located between Bellevue college and the Lake Hills Greenbelt. Bird watching is one of my passions. 
          Do birds see my city like this? <br>I visit the parks and natural areas in Washington to appreciate them in spring when migratory birds are present. 
          You can see birds, other wildlife and several interesting bird watching sites here, as well as my backyard.   
          I took all pictures other than: this bird's eyeview image opposite the introduction, the bottom row on the animals page and the camera equipment. </p>

          <p><strong>My yard: </strong></p><p> My yard which is about one quarter acre contains several types of trees including western red cedar, douglas fir and big leaf maple. <br>
          Birds and animals live in the neighborhood. I enjoy watching them and taking pictures of them. 
          The blue birds below, Steller's Jays, and Washington native squirrel shows up on my deck for food evryday. You can see them here at my feeder. 
          A native Douglas squirrel showed up, unlike the gray squirrels, he was not scared of me and takes nuts from my hand. 
          I find birds really fascinating creatures because of their beautiful color and shape. I want to visit Costa Rica again next year and include some bird pictures from there as well.</p>

            <p><strong>Avian dinosaurs: </strong></p><p>The fossil record demonstrates that birds are modern feathered dinosaurs, having evolved from earlier feathered dinosaurs within the theropod group, which are traditionally placed within the saurischian dinosaurs. 
            The closest living relatives of birds are the crocodilians. Primitive bird-like dinosaurs that lie outside class Aves proper, in the broader group Avialae, have been found dating back to the mid-Jurassic period, around 170 million years ago. 
            Many of these early "stem-birds", such as Archaeopteryx, retained primitive characteristics such as teeth and long bony tails. DNA-based evidence finds that birds diversified dramatically around the time of the Cretaceousâ€“Palaeogene extinction event 66 million years ago, 
            which killed off the pterosaurs and all the non-avian dinosaur lineages. But birds, especially those in the southern continents, survived this event and then migrated to other parts of the world while diversifying during periods of global cooling. 
            This makes them the sole surviving dinosaurs according to cladistics.</p>
