                <p><strong>Introduction: </strong></p><p>I live in Bellevue, Washington. There are several types of trees in my yard which about half acre square feet. <br>
                Birds and animals live around here. I enjoy watching them and taking pictures of them. 
                Blue birds, Steller's Jay, and Washington native squirrel shows up in my deck for food evryday.
                He was not scared of me unlike gray squirrel and takes peanuts from my hand.  I call him Hoppy because of his rabbit like movement.
                You can see them here I encounter in my yard. This is my hand feeding a squirrel in my back yard.

                <p><strong>Avian dinosaurs: </strong></p><p>The fossil record demonstrates that birds are modern feathered dinosaurs, having evolved from earlier feathered dinosaurs within the theropod group, which are traditionally placed within the saurischian dinosaurs. 
                The closest living relatives of birds are the crocodilians. Primitive bird-like dinosaurs that lie outside class Aves proper, in the broader group Avialae, have been found dating back to the mid-Jurassic period, around 170 million years ago. 
                Many of these early "stem-birds", such as Archaeopteryx, retained primitive characteristics such as teeth and long bony tails. DNA-based evidence finds that birds diversified dramatically around the time of the Cretaceousâ€“Palaeogene extinction event 66 million years ago, 
                which killed off the pterosaurs and all the non-avian dinosaur lineages. But birds, especially those in the southern continents, survived this event and then migrated to other parts of the world while diversifying during periods of global cooling. 
                This makes them the sole surviving dinosaurs according to cladistics.
