          <p><strong>Introduction: </strong></p><p>I live in Lake Hills in Bellevue. Bird watching is one of my passions. <br>
          Do birds see my city like this? I visit park and natural reserve in Washington to appreciate them in spring when many birds became active. 
          I'll show you birds and several sites as well as my backyard. I made referece those birding sites to Wikipedia whee they locate, athough I mentioned those birds which I actually saw there. 
          I also took pictures of some of animals and flowers in my yard.</p>

          <p><strong>My yard: </strong></p><p> There are several types of trees in my yard which about half acre square feet. <br>
          Birds and animals live in the neighborhood. I enjoy watching them and taking pictures of them. 
          Blue birds below, Steller's Jay, and Washington native squirrel shows up on my deck for food evryday. You can see them here I encounter in my yard. 
          A native Douglas squirrel showed up and he was not scared of me unlike the gray squirrels and takes nuts from my hand. I call him Hoppy because of his rabbit like movement.
          I find birds really fascinating creatures because of their beautiful color and shape. I want to visit Costa Rica again next year and introduce some birding spots where I went here in Washington as well.</p>

            <p><strong>Avian dinosaurs: </strong></p><p>The fossil record demonstrates that birds are modern feathered dinosaurs, having evolved from earlier feathered dinosaurs within the theropod group, which are traditionally placed within the saurischian dinosaurs. 
            The closest living relatives of birds are the crocodilians. Primitive bird-like dinosaurs that lie outside class Aves proper, in the broader group Avialae, have been found dating back to the mid-Jurassic period, around 170 million years ago. 
            Many of these early "stem-birds", such as Archaeopteryx, retained primitive characteristics such as teeth and long bony tails. DNA-based evidence finds that birds diversified dramatically around the time of the Cretaceousâ€“Palaeogene extinction event 66 million years ago, 
            which killed off the pterosaurs and all the non-avian dinosaur lineages. But birds, especially those in the southern continents, survived this event and then migrated to other parts of the world while diversifying during periods of global cooling. 
            This makes them the sole surviving dinosaurs according to cladistics.</p>
