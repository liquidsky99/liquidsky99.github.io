        <h3>OM-D E-M1 Mark II Body</h3>
        <p>Bird photography is one of my passions. I use these camera and lenses for shooting birds. There is so much variety in birds, different shapes and colours, in the world.  
        They move and fly around often and unpredictably, and don't want to be close to me. It requires more functionalities of my lenses than any other photography like scenary and portrait.
        I use Micro four-thirds (MFT) cameras for bird photography.The range can be half the size and weight of equivalent lenses on full-frame systems. This small body and high-quality features including high dynamic range, better sensors.
        "Olympus’s advanced 5-Axis Image Stabilization, which compensates for all types of camera motion to provide up to 5.5 stops of correction when shooting handheld, 
        giving Bourne the freedom to react quickly to his fast-moving subjects.”

        <p>The longer-ranged, sharper and faster these lenses get, however, the heavier and more expensive they are.
         This lighter and smaller lens because they do not need to reproduce as large of an image onto the sensor. This portablitity is important for me since I don't want to carry a tripod.
         Significantly longer focal lengths. A 100mm lens on a micro 4/3 camera is like a 200mm lens on a full-frame DSLR. This feature is great for wildlife photograpy.</p>

        <h3>M.ZUIKO DIGITAL ED 12-200mm F3.5-6.3</h3>
        <p>The scenary in this site was taken by this lens. This is a very compact lens, weighing in at a modest 455g, yet it covers a huge 24-400mm equivalent focal length range.
        With a working distance of 10cm at the wide end and 50cm at the telephoto, it’s a versatile lens that can get the shot in almost any setting or situation.</p>
