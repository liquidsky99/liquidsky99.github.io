        <p><br> I graduated college with BA in political science and became a High school teacher in Japan.  However, I changed my career path.  
            After obtaining an Associate degree in Accounting, I’m now taking classes in the Information Technology program because of my experience in the IT industry in California.
            I love traveling and hiking as well as photographing scenery and birds.  When I lived in Germany and France, I visited many places in Europe.  
            I always find it interesting to talk with people from all over the world. I’ve been to Ecuador and Costa Rica for birdwatching since I moved back to the US.  
            This class is enjoyable and helpful for me to improve my skills to create my websites. </p>
