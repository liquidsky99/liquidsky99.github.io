        <p> I graduated with BA in political science and became High school teacher in Japan. However, I have changed my career path. 
        After obtaining Associate degree in Accounting, I’m now taking classes for Information Technology program because of my experience in IT industry in California. </p> <p>I love traveling and hiking as photographing scenery as well as birds.
        When I lived in Germany and France, I visited many places in Europe. I’ve been Ecuador and Mexico since I moved to US. I always found interesting to communicate with people all over the world. 
        This clas is enjoyable and helpful for me to learn how to make my web portfolio.</p>
